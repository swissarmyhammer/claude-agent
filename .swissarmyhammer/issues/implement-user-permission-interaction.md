# Implement User Permission Interaction

## Description
Implement actual user interaction for permission requests instead of auto-selecting responses.

## Location
`lib/src/agent.rs:3176`

## Code Context
```rust
// TODO: Implement actual user interaction
// For now, we'll still auto-select "allow-once" but in a real implementation
```

## Current Behavior
Currently auto-selects "allow-once" for all permission requests.

## Implementation Notes
- Design user interaction flow for permission requests
- Support multiple response options (allow-once, allow-always, deny)
- Add timeout handling for user responses
- Consider batch permission requests
- Maintain user preference history
