# Implement Tool Call Kinds (ToolKind) Classification

## Problem
Our tool call reporting doesn't implement the tool kind classification system required by the ACP specification. Tool kinds help clients choose appropriate icons and optimize how they display tool execution progress.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/tool-calls:

**Required Tool Kinds:**
- `read` - Reading files or data
- `edit` - Modifying files or content
- `delete` - Removing files or data
- `move` - Moving or renaming files
- `search` - Searching for information
- `execute` - Running commands or code
- `think` - Internal reasoning or planning
- `fetch` - Retrieving external data
- `other` - Other tool types (default)

**Tool Kind Usage:**
```json
{
  "sessionUpdate": "tool_call",
  "toolCallId": "call_001",
  "title": "Reading configuration file",
  "kind": "read",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

## Current Issues
- Tool kind classification and reporting unclear
- No automatic tool kind detection based on tool operation
- Missing tool kind validation and consistency
- No integration with client UI optimization hints

## Implementation Tasks

### Tool Kind Enumeration
- [ ] Define complete `ToolKind` enum with all ACP-specified variants
- [ ] Add proper serialization/deserialization for tool kinds
- [ ] Implement tool kind validation and consistency checking
- [ ] Support tool kind defaulting to `other` when unspecified

### Tool Kind Classification Logic
- [ ] Implement automatic tool kind detection based on tool name/operation
- [ ] Add tool kind assignment rules for common tool patterns
- [ ] Support manual tool kind override for specific tools
- [ ] Create tool kind mapping configuration system
- [ ] Add tool kind inference from tool parameters and context

### Tool Kind Integration
- [ ] Integrate tool kind assignment into tool call reporting
- [ ] Add tool kind validation during tool execution
- [ ] Support tool kind updates during tool lifecycle
- [ ] Include tool kind in tool call status updates
- [ ] Add tool kind filtering and querying capabilities

## Tool Kind Implementation
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ToolKind {
    Read,
    Edit, 
    Delete,
    Move,
    Search,
    Execute,
    Think,
    Fetch,
    Other,
}

impl ToolKind {
    pub fn from_tool_name(tool_name: &str) -> Self {
        match tool_name {
            "read_file" | "cat" | "head" | "tail" => ToolKind::Read,
            "write_file" | "edit_file" | "modify" => ToolKind::Edit,
            "delete_file" | "rm" | "remove" => ToolKind::Delete,
            "move_file" | "mv" | "rename" => ToolKind::Move,
            "grep" | "find" | "search" => ToolKind::Search,
            "bash" | "shell" | "execute" | "run" => ToolKind::Execute,
            "think" | "reason" | "plan" => ToolKind::Think,
            "curl" | "wget" | "fetch" | "download" => ToolKind::Fetch,
            _ => ToolKind::Other,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn from_operation(operation: &ToolOperation) -> Self {
        match operation {
            ToolOperation::FileRead(_) => ToolKind::Read,
            ToolOperation::FileWrite(_) => ToolKind::Edit,
            ToolOperation::FileDelete(_) => ToolKind::Delete,
            ToolOperation::FileMove(_, _) => ToolKind::Move,
            ToolOperation::Search(_) => ToolKind::Search,
            ToolOperation::CommandExecution(_) => ToolKind::Execute,
            ToolOperation::HttpRequest(_) => ToolKind::Fetch,
            ToolOperation::InternalReasoning => ToolKind::Think,
            _ => ToolKind::Other,
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
Add tool kind classification comments:
```rust
// ACP tool kinds enable client UI optimization and user experience:
// 1. read: File/data reading operations - clients can show read icons
// 2. edit: Content modification - clients can highlight changes
// 3. delete: Removal operations - clients can show warning indicators
// 4. move: File movement/rename - clients can track location changes  
// 5. search: Information discovery - clients can show search progress
// 6. execute: Command execution - clients can show terminal-like UI
// 7. think: Agent reasoning - clients can show thinking indicators
// 8. fetch: External data retrieval - clients can show network activity
// 9. other: Fallback for unclassified tools
//
// Proper classification improves client user experience and tool visibility.
```

### Tool Kind Detection Strategies

## Tool Kind Classification Examples
```rust
impl ToolKindClassifier {
    pub fn classify_tool(&self, tool: &Tool) -> ToolKind {
        // Check explicit tool kind annotation
        if let Some(kind) = tool.declared_kind() {
            return kind;
        }
        
        // Classify by tool name patterns
        if let Some(kind) = ToolKind::from_tool_name(&tool.name) {
            return kind;
        }
        
        // Classify by operation type
        if let Some(operation) = tool.operation_type() {
            return ToolKind::from_operation(&operation);
        }
        
        // Classify by parameters and context
        if let Some(kind) = self.classify_by_parameters(&tool.parameters) {
            return kind;
        }
        
        // Default fallback
        ToolKind::Other
    }
}
```

## Analysis

The ToolKind classification system is **already implemented** in the codebase with most requirements met:

### Already Implemented ✅
1. **Complete ToolKind enum** (lib/src/tool_types.rs:14-34) - All 9 ACP-specified variants
2. **Automatic classification** (lib/src/tool_classification.rs:10-83) - Based on tool names
3. **ACP integration** (lib/src/tool_types.rs:352-367) - Conversion to agent_client_protocol::ToolKind
4. **Used in tool reporting** (lib/src/tools.rs:296) - ToolKind assigned during tool call creation
5. **File location extraction** - Already tracking file paths for follow-along features
6. **Comprehensive tests** - Basic classification tests exist for all major kinds

### Missing Implementation ❌
1. **Think kind classification** - No tools are classified as ToolKind::Think
2. **Think kind tests** - No tests for the Think classification

## Root Cause

The `ToolKind::Think` variant exists in the enum but is never assigned by `classify_tool()`. The ACP spec states that Think is for "internal reasoning or planning" - but the current classification logic doesn't map any tools to this kind.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Add Think Kind Classification
Update `lib/src/tool_classification.rs` to classify thinking/reasoning tools:
- Add pattern matching for hypothetical planning/reasoning tools
- Document when Think kind should be used vs Other

### 2. Add Tests for Think Kind
Add test coverage in `lib/src/tools.rs`:
- Test Think kind serialization/deserialization
- Test Think kind conversion to ACP format
- Document the Think kind usage pattern

### Implementation Approach

The Think kind is designed for internal agent reasoning that isn't a concrete external action. Since this agent doesn't currently have explicit "thinking" or "planning" tool calls (reasoning happens within the agent), we should:

1. Document that Think is reserved for future internal reasoning tools
2. Add a test showing Think classification works correctly
3. Ensure Think properly serializes and converts to ACP format

This maintains ACP compliance while acknowledging the current architecture doesn't use explicit reasoning tool calls.

## Implementation Complete ✅

### Changes Made

1. **Added Think Kind Classification** (lib/src/tool_classification.rs:48-55)
   - Added pattern matching for: `think`, `reason`, `plan`, `analyze_approach`, `generate_strategy`
   - Documented that Think is for agent internal reasoning
   - Note that current architecture doesn't use explicit reasoning tool calls, but the kind is available for future features

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** (lib/src/tools.rs:3295-3526)
   - Added tests for all Think kind tool names
   - Added serialization tests for all 9 ToolKind variants
   - Added deserialization tests for all 9 ToolKind variants including unknown variant fallback
   - Added ACP conversion tests for all 9 ToolKind variants
   - Added lifecycle test ensuring kind is preserved through ToolCallReport creation and ACP conversion

### Test Results
- All 475 tests pass
- Cargo fmt: Clean
- Cargo clippy: No warnings or errors

### Key Implementation Details

The ToolKind classification system is now complete with:
- All 9 ACP-specified kinds implemented and tested
- Automatic classification based on tool names
- Proper serialization to/from snake_case JSON
- Correct conversion to agent_client_protocol::ToolKind
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring all variants work correctly

The Think kind is available for future use when the agent implements explicit reasoning or planning tools, or when MCP servers provide thinking tools.
