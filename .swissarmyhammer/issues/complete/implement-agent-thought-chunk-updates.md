# Implement Agent Thought Chunk Updates

## Problem
Our agent implementation doesn't send agent thought chunk updates via `session/update` notifications to provide transparency about internal reasoning and planning processes. This limits client visibility into agent decision-making.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From agent-client-protocol specification:

**Agent Thought Chunk Format:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456", 
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "agent_thought_chunk",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "I need to analyze this code systematically. First, I'll check for syntax errors, then look for potential type issues..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Provide transparency into agent reasoning and decision-making
- Enable clients to show agent thinking process to users
- Support debugging and understanding of agent behavior
- Enhance user trust through visibility into agent logic

## Current Issues
- No agent thought chunk updates sent during processing
- Internal reasoning and planning not visible to clients
- Missing transparency in agent decision-making process
- Limited insight into agent problem-solving approach

            session_id: session_id.clone(),
            update: SessionUpdate::AgentThoughtChunk {
                content: ContentBlock::Text(TextContent {
                    text: thought.to_string(),
                    annotations: None,
                    meta: None,
                }),
            },
            meta: None,
        };
        
        self.send_session_update(notification).await
    }
    
    async fn process_prompt_with_thoughts(
        &self,
        session_id: &SessionId,
        prompt: &[ContentBlock],
    ) -> crate::Result<PromptResponse> {
        // Send initial analysis thought
        self.send_agent_thought(
            session_id,
            "Analyzing the user's request and determining the best approach..."
        ).await?;
        
        // Analyze prompt and generate plan
        let analysis = self.analyze_prompt(prompt).await?;
        
        // Send planning thought
        self.send_agent_thought(
            session_id,
            &format!("I'll approach this by: {}", analysis.approach_description)
        ).await?;
        
        // Continue with execution...
        self.execute_plan_with_thoughts(session_id, &analysis.plan).await
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
Add agent thought chunk comments:
```rust
// ACP agent thought chunks provide reasoning transparency:
// 1. Send agent_thought_chunk updates during internal processing
// 2. Verbalize reasoning steps and decision-making process
// 3. Provide insight into problem analysis and planning
// 4. Enable clients to show agent thinking to users
// 5. Support debugging and understanding of agent behavior
//
// Thought chunks enhance user trust and system transparency.
```

### Reasoning Step Detection
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ReasoningStep {
    ProblemAnalysis,
    ToolSelection,
    StrategyPlanning,
    TaskDecomposition,
    DecisionMaking,
    ResultEvaluation,
}

impl AgentReasoner {
    pub async fn reason_through_step(
        &self,
        step: ReasoningStep,
        context: &ReasoningContext,
    ) -> Result<ReasoningResult, ReasoningError> {
        let thought = match step {
            ReasoningStep::ProblemAnalysis => {
                format!("Analyzing the problem: {}", context.problem_description)
            }
            ReasoningStep::ToolSelection => {
                format!("Selecting appropriate tools: {}", context.available_tools.join(", "))
            }
            ReasoningStep::StrategyPlanning => {
                format!("Planning approach: {}", context.strategy_description)
            }
            // ... other reasoning steps
        };
        
        // Send thought update
        self.send_agent_thought(&context.session_id, &thought).await?;
        
        // Perform actual reasoning
        self.execute_reasoning_step(step, context).await
    }
}

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current codebase architecture, I propose the following implementation approach:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. **Verify ACP Support**: Check if `SessionUpdate::AgentThoughtChunk` variant exists in `agent_client_protocol` 0.4.3, or if we need to use a workaround with `AgentMessageChunk`
2. **Create Thought Generation Trait**: Implement a trait for generating contextual agent thoughts during different reasoning phases
3. **Extend ClaudeAgent**: Add methods to send agent thought chunks using the existing session update infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
1. **Reasoning Phase Detection**: Identify key points in the agent workflow where thoughts should be generated:
   - Initial prompt analysis
   - Tool selection and strategy planning  
   - Problem decomposition
   - Decision-making checkpoints
   - Result evaluation

2. **Thought Content Generation**: Create meaningful thought content that provides insight into agent reasoning:
   ```rust
   pub struct AgentThought {
       phase: ReasoningPhase,
       content: String,
       context: Option<serde_json::Value>,
   }
   
   pub enum ReasoningPhase {
       PromptAnalysis,
       StrategyPlanning,
       ToolSelection,
       ProblemDecomposition,
       Execution,
       ResultEvaluation,
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Points**: Instrument existing methods in `ClaudeAgent`:
   - `process_prompt()` - Add initial analysis thoughts
   - Tool execution methods - Add decision-making thoughts
   - Response synthesis - Add evaluation thoughts

### Phase 3: Session Update Integration
1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Use the current `send_session_update()` method with `SessionNotification`
2. **Handle AgentThoughtChunk Variant**: 
   - If available, use `SessionUpdate::AgentThoughtChunk { content }`
   - If not available, use `SessionUpdate::AgentMessageChunk` with special metadata to indicate thought content
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure agent processing continues even if thought sending fails

### Phase 4: Configuration and Testing
1. **Thought Verbosity Control**: Add configuration options for thought frequency and detail level
2. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure thought generation doesn't significantly impact response time
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test thought generation across different agent workflows

### Implementation Strategy
The implementation will follow TDD principles:
1. Write tests for thought generation and sending
2. Implement minimal viable thought infrastructure
3. Integrate with existing agent workflow step-by-step
4. Refactor and optimize based on test results

### Expected Benefits
- Enhanced transparency in agent decision-making
- Better debugging capabilities for agent behavior
- Improved user trust through visibility into reasoning process
- Foundation for future agent introspection features

### Next Steps for Enhancement
While the core implementation is complete and functional, potential future enhancements could include:

- Thought filtering based on client preferences  
- Additional reasoning phases for specialized scenarios
- Performance metrics collection for thought processing
- Integration with tool selection and execution workflows

### Test Results
