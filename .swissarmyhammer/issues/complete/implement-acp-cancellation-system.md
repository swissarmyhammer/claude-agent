# Implement ACP Cancellation System

## Problem
Our prompt processing doesn't implement the complete cancellation system required by the ACP specification. We need to handle `session/cancel` notifications, immediately cancel all ongoing operations, and respond with proper `cancelled` stop reasons.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/prompt-turn:

**Cancellation Flow:**
1. Client sends `session/cancel` notification
2. Client marks all pending tool calls as `cancelled`
3. Client responds to pending `session/request_permission` with `cancelled`
4. Agent stops all operations and sends final updates
5. Agent responds to original `session/prompt` with `cancelled` stop reason

**Cancellation Notification:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/cancel",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456"
  }
}
```

**Final Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "stopReason": "cancelled"
  }
}
```

## Current Issues
- Missing `session/cancel` notification handling
- No immediate cancellation of ongoing operations
- Missing proper `cancelled` stop reason response
- No tool call cancellation coordination
- Missing permission request cancellation handling

## Implementation Tasks

### Cancellation Notification Handling
- [ ] Register `session/cancel` notification handler
- [ ] Validate session ID in cancellation requests
- [ ] Trigger immediate cancellation of all session operations
- [ ] Log cancellation requests for debugging and monitoring

### Operation Cancellation Coordination
- [ ] Cancel all ongoing language model requests immediately
- [ ] Cancel all in-progress tool executions
- [ ] Cancel any pending permission requests
- [ ] Stop any streaming operations or file transfers
- [ ] Coordinate cancellation across multiple concurrent operations

### Tool Call Cancellation
- [ ] Mark all pending/in-progress tool calls as `cancelled`
- [ ] Send `tool_call_update` notifications with `cancelled` status
- [ ] Clean up tool execution resources and processes
- [ ] Handle tool call cancellation gracefully without data corruption

### Permission Request Cancellation
- [ ] Respond to pending `session/request_permission` with `cancelled`
- [ ] Clean up permission request state
- [ ] Handle permission cancellation in tool execution flow
- [ ] Coordinate permission cancellation with client expectations

### Language Model Request Cancellation
- [ ] Implement cancellation of ongoing LM API calls
- [ ] Handle partial responses from cancelled LM requests
- [ ] Clean up streaming connections and resources
- [ ] Ensure no orphaned LM requests continue processing

## Cancellation State Management
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct CancellationState {
    pub cancelled: bool,
    pub cancellation_time: SystemTime,
    pub cancelled_operations: HashSet<String>,
    pub pending_cleanup: Vec<CleanupTask>,
}

impl CancellationState {
    pub fn cancel_all(&mut self) -> Vec<CancellationTask>;
    pub fn is_cancelled(&self) -> bool;
    pub fn add_cancelled_operation(&mut self, operation_id: String);
}
```

## Implementation Notes
Add cancellation system comments:
```rust
// ACP requires immediate and comprehensive cancellation handling:
// 1. Process session/cancel notifications immediately
// 2. Cancel ALL ongoing operations (LM, tools, permissions)
// 3. Send final status updates before responding
// 4. Respond to original session/prompt with cancelled stop reason
// 5. Clean up all resources and prevent orphaned operations
//
// Cancellation must be fast and reliable to maintain responsiveness.
```

### Immediate Response Requirements
- [ ] Process cancellation notifications with highest priority
- [ ] Interrupt blocking operations immediately
- [ ] Set cancellation flags before starting cleanup
- [ ] Ensure cancellation state is thread-safe
- [ ] Handle concurrent cancellation requests

### Final Update Coordination
- [ ] Send all pending `session/update` notifications before responding
- [ ] Include final tool call status updates
- [ ] Send any remaining progress updates
- [ ] Ensure proper ordering of final notifications
- [ ] Handle client disconnection during final updates

### Resource Cleanup
- [ ] Clean up file handles and temporary files
- [ ] Terminate child processes spawned by tools
- [ ] Close network connections and streams
- [ ] Release memory and computational resources
- [ ] Clean up session state and caches

### Error Handling During Cancellation
- [ ] Handle errors during cancellation gracefully
- [ ] Ensure cancellation completes even if cleanup fails
- [ ] Log cancellation errors without blocking response
- [ ] Prevent cancellation errors from causing deadlocks
- [ ] Support partial cancellation scenarios

## Client-Side Coordination
The implementation must coordinate with expected client behavior:
- [ ] Handle clients that mark tool calls as cancelled preemptively
- [ ] Support clients that cancel permission requests immediately
- [ ] Coordinate with client UI updates during cancellation
- [ ] Handle network issues during cancellation

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test basic session cancellation with immediate response
- [ ] Test cancellation during tool execution with proper status updates
- [ ] Test cancellation during language model requests
- [ ] Test cancellation during permission requests
- [ ] Test concurrent operation cancellation
- [ ] Test resource cleanup after cancellation
- [ ] Test cancellation error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Test client disconnection during cancellation

## Performance Requirements
- [ ] Cancellation response time under 100ms
- [ ] Efficient cancellation of large numbers of operations
- [ ] Non-blocking cancellation implementation
- [ ] Minimal resource usage during cancellation
- [ ] Fast cleanup of cancelled operations

## Integration Points
- [ ] Connect to language model API cancellation mechanisms
- [ ] Integrate with tool execution cancellation
- [ ] Connect to permission request system
- [ ] Integrate with session update notification system
- [ ] Connect to session management for state cleanup

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- [ ] Handle cancellation of already completed operations
- [ ] Handle double cancellation requests
- [ ] Handle cancellation during session loading
- [ ] Handle cancellation with no active operations
- [ ] Handle cancellation during initialization

## Acceptance Criteria
- `session/cancel` notifications processed immediately
- All ongoing operations cancelled within 100ms
- Final `session/update` notifications sent before response
- Original `session/prompt` responds with `cancelled` stop reason
- Tool calls marked as `cancelled` with proper status updates
- Permission requests cancelled with `cancelled` outcome
- Comprehensive resource cleanup completed
- No orphaned operations or resource leaks
- Comprehensive test coverage for all cancellation scenarios
- Integration with existing session and tool management systems
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified the key components needed to implement the ACP cancellation system:

### Current State Analysis
- The `ClaudeAgent` already implements a placeholder `cancel` method that does nothing
- The server routes requests correctly and has notification infrastructure
- Session management and Claude client integration are in place
- Tool execution system exists but lacks cancellation support

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Cancellation State Management
Create a thread-safe cancellation state system:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::sync::{RwLock, broadcast};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::time::SystemTime;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct CancellationState {
    pub cancelled: bool,
    pub cancellation_time: SystemTime,
    pub cancelled_operations: HashSet<String>,
    pub cancellation_reason: String,
}

pub struct CancellationManager {
    // Session ID -> CancellationState
    cancellation_states: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, CancellationState>>>,
    // Broadcast channel for immediate cancellation notifications
    cancellation_sender: broadcast::Sender<String>, // session_id
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Agent Structure
Add cancellation support to `ClaudeAgent`:

```rust
pub struct ClaudeAgent {
    // ... existing fields ...
    cancellation_manager: Arc<CancellationManager>,
}
```

#### 3. Implement session/cancel Handler
Transform the placeholder `cancel` method into a complete implementation:

```rust
async fn cancel(
    &self,
    notification: CancelNotification,
) -> Result<(), agent_client_protocol::Error> {
    let session_id = &notification.session_id.0;
    
    // 1. Immediately mark session as cancelled
    self.cancellation_manager.mark_cancelled(session_id).await;
    
    // 2. Cancel all ongoing operations for this session
    self.cancel_claude_requests(session_id).await;
    self.cancel_tool_executions(session_id).await;
    self.cancel_permission_requests(session_id).await;
    
    // 3. Send final status updates
    self.send_final_cancellation_updates(session_id).await;
    
    // 4. Broadcast cancellation to all operation handlers
    self.cancellation_manager.broadcast_cancellation(session_id).await;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 4. Operation Cancellation Integration
Modify the `prompt` method to check for cancellation:

```rust
async fn prompt(&self, request: PromptRequest) -> Result<PromptResponse, agent_client_protocol::Error> {
    let session_id = request.session_id.0.clone();
    
    // Check if already cancelled before starting
    if self.cancellation_manager.is_cancelled(&session_id).await {
        return Ok(PromptResponse {
            stop_reason: StopReason::Cancelled,
            meta: Some(json!({"cancelled_before_start": true}))
        });
    }
    
    // ... existing validation code ...
    
    // Handle streaming with cancellation support
    if self.should_stream(&session, &request) {
        self.handle_streaming_prompt_with_cancellation(&session_id, &request, &updated_session).await?
    } else {
        self.handle_non_streaming_prompt_with_cancellation(&session_id, &request, &updated_session).await?
    }
}
```

#### 5. Claude Client Cancellation Support
Enhance Claude API requests with cancellation:

```rust
impl ClaudeClient {
    pub async fn query_with_cancellation(
        &self,
        prompt: &str,
        context: &SessionContext,
        cancellation_receiver: &mut broadcast::Receiver<String>,
    ) -> Result<String, ClaudeError> {
        // Use tokio::select! to race between Claude API response and cancellation
        tokio::select! {
            result = self.query_with_context(prompt, context) => {
                result
            }
            _ = cancellation_receiver.recv() => {
                Err(ClaudeError::Cancelled)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 6. Tool Execution Cancellation
Modify tool execution to support cancellation:

```rust
impl ToolCallHandler {
    pub async fn execute_tool_with_cancellation(
        &self,
        tool_call: ToolCall,
        cancellation_receiver: &mut broadcast::Receiver<String>,
    ) -> ToolCallResult {
        tokio::select! {
            result = self.execute_tool(tool_call) => {
                result
            }
            _ = cancellation_receiver.recv() => {
                ToolCallResult::Cancelled
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 7. Final Update Coordination
Before responding to the original prompt with `cancelled`, send all final updates:

```rust
async fn send_final_cancellation_updates(&self, session_id: &str) {
    // Send tool call cancelled updates
    for pending_tool_call in self.get_pending_tool_calls(session_id) {
        let notification = SessionNotification {
            session_id: SessionId(session_id.into()),
            update: SessionUpdate::ToolCallUpdate {
                call_id: pending_tool_call.id,
                status: ToolCallStatus::Cancelled,
                result: None,
            },
            meta: Some(json!({"cancelled_at": SystemTime::now()}))
        };
        self.send_session_update(notification).await;
    }
    
    // Send any other pending updates...
}
```

### Integration Points
1. **Server Layer**: No changes needed - already routes `session/cancel` notifications
2. **Session Manager**: Add cancellation state tracking per session
3. **Claude Client**: Add cancellation token support using `tokio::select!`
4. **Tool Handler**: Add cancellation support to tool execution
5. **MCP Manager**: Add cancellation support for MCP tool calls

### Performance Requirements
- Cancellation response time: Under 100ms
- Use `tokio::select!` for non-blocking cancellation
- Minimal memory overhead with `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>`
- Efficient broadcast channels for immediate notification

This solution provides comprehensive cancellation that meets all ACP specification requirements while integrating seamlessly with the existing architecture.
