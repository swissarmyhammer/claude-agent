# Implement UTF-8 Processing in Terminal Manager

## Description
Terminal manager has placeholder implementation for UTF-8 processing that needs completion.

## Found Issues
- `terminal_manager.rs:1`: UTF-8 processing implementation placeholder
- Missing proper terminal encoding handling
- Need robust terminal output processing

## Priority
Medium - Terminal functionality

## Files Affected
- `lib/src/terminal_manager.rs`


## Proposed Solution

After reviewing the code, the UTF-8 processing is already implemented in `terminal_manager.rs`:

1. **Current Implementation** (lines 700-740):
   - `add_output` method handles buffer truncation
   - `find_utf8_boundary` detects valid UTF-8 character boundaries
   - Truncation happens from the beginning when buffer exceeds limit
   - Uses continuation byte detection: `(byte & 0b1100_0000) != 0b1000_0000`

2. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The algorithm scans forward from the minimum position to find a non-continuation byte
   - This ensures truncation happens at a valid UTF-8 character boundary
   - Prevents creating invalid UTF-8 sequences
   - Uses `String::from_utf8_lossy` for safe conversion

3. **Potential Issues Identified**:
   - No tests for multi-byte UTF-8 characters (emoji, CJK, etc.)
   - No tests for boundary detection edge cases
   - No tests for truncation at various UTF-8 byte positions
   - No validation that truncated output is always valid UTF-8

4. **Solution Approach**:
   - Write comprehensive tests for UTF-8 edge cases
   - Test 1-byte ASCII characters
   - Test 2-byte characters (Latin extended, Cyrillic, etc.)
   - Test 3-byte characters (CJK, most symbols)
   - Test 4-byte characters (emoji, rare symbols)
   - Test truncation at each byte position of multi-byte sequences
   - Verify all outputs are valid UTF-8
   - Test the boundary detection algorithm directly

5. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Add test helper to create TerminalSession for testing
   - Create test cases covering all UTF-8 character sizes
   - Test truncation behavior with mixed-width characters
   - Verify buffer limits are respected
   - Ensure get_output_string always returns valid UTF-8




## Implementation Notes

### Work Completed

1. **Analyzed existing UTF-8 implementation**:
   - Reviewed `add_output` method (lines 700-720)
   - Reviewed `find_utf8_boundary` method (lines 722-740)
   - Confirmed implementation correctly handles UTF-8 character boundaries

2. **Implementation verification**:
   - The `find_utf8_boundary` algorithm correctly identifies UTF-8 start bytes vs continuation bytes
   - Uses bit masking: `(byte & 0b1100_0000) != 0b1000_0000` to detect continuation bytes
   - Scans forward from minimum position to find next valid character boundary
   - Prevents truncation mid-character for multi-byte UTF-8 sequences

3. **Added comprehensive test coverage** (27 new tests):
   - Test 1-byte ASCII characters
   - Test 2-byte characters (Cyrillic: –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç –º–∏—Ä)
   - Test 3-byte characters (Chinese: ‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå)
   - Test 4-byte characters (Emoji: üëã üåç)
   - Test mixed-width character handling
   - Test truncation at various UTF-8 boundaries
   - Test boundary detection for all character widths
   - Test incremental output with truncation
   - Test edge cases (null bytes, exact limits, etc.)

4. **Test results**:
   - All 41 terminal_manager tests pass
   - Full test suite: 679 tests pass
   - cargo fmt: formatting clean
   - cargo clippy: no warnings (fixed len_zero lint)

### Key Findings

The UTF-8 processing implementation was **already complete and correct**. The issue description mentioned "placeholder implementation" but no placeholder code exists. The implementation properly:

- Handles all UTF-8 character widths (1-4 bytes)
- Truncates at safe character boundaries
- Prevents invalid UTF-8 sequences
- Uses efficient bit-masking for continuation byte detection
- Converts output safely with `String::from_utf8_lossy`

### What Was Actually Missing

The implementation lacked **test coverage** for UTF-8 edge cases. Added 27 comprehensive tests covering:
- Multi-byte character handling
- Boundary detection correctness
- Truncation behavior
- Incremental output
- Edge cases

All tests pass, confirming the UTF-8 processing implementation is robust and production-ready.
