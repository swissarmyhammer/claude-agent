# Complete MCP Server Configuration Support

## Problem
Our session setup doesn't fully implement all MCP transport types and their required parameters as specified in the ACP specification. We need complete support for stdio (mandatory), HTTP (optional), and SSE (deprecated but spec-compliant) transports.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/session-setup:

**All Agents MUST support stdio transport:**
```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "command": "/path/to/mcp-server",
  "args": ["--stdio"],
  "env": [
    {"name": "API_KEY", "value": "secret123"}
  ]
}
```

**HTTP transport (if mcpCapabilities.http: true):**
```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "name": "api-server",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
  "headers": [
    {"name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer token123"},
    {"name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json"}
  ]
}
```

**SSE transport (if mcpCapabilities.sse: true):**
```json
{
  "type": "sse",
  "name": "event-stream", 
  "url": "https://events.example.com/mcp",
  "headers": [
    {"name": "X-API-Key", "value": "apikey456"}
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Tasks

### Transport Type Structures
- [ ] Create `McpServerConfig` enum with all transport variants
- [ ] Implement `StdioTransport` with command, args, env fields
- [ ] Implement `HttpTransport` with type, name, url, headers fields
- [ ] Implement `SseTransport` with type, name, url, headers fields
- [ ] Add `EnvVariable` struct with name/value fields
- [ ] Add `HttpHeader` struct with name/value fields

### Transport Validation
- [ ] Validate stdio transport configurations (command path, args format)
- [ ] Validate HTTP transport configurations (URL format, headers)
- [ ] Validate SSE transport configurations (URL format, headers)
- [ ] Ensure transport types match declared capabilities
- [ ] Reject HTTP/SSE if not declared in mcpCapabilities

### Connection Management
- [ ] Implement stdio MCP server process spawning with env vars
- [ ] Implement HTTP MCP client with proper headers
- [ ] Implement SSE MCP client (even if deprecated)
- [ ] Add connection lifecycle management for all transports
- [ ] Handle connection failures gracefully

### Parameter Validation
- [ ] Validate command paths are absolute for stdio transport
- [ ] Validate URLs are properly formatted for HTTP/SSE
- [ ] Validate environment variable names and values
- [ ] Validate HTTP header names and values
- [ ] Sanitize and escape parameters appropriately

## Implementation Notes
Add transport support comments:
```rust
// ACP requires support for all MCP transport types:
// - stdio: MANDATORY - all agents must support
// - http: OPTIONAL - only if mcpCapabilities.http: true
// - sse: OPTIONAL - deprecated but still part of spec
//
// Transport validation must check against declared capabilities.
```

## Error Handling
Proper error responses for transport issues:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "HTTP transport not supported: agent did not declare mcpCapabilities.http",
    "data": {
      "requestedTransport": "http",
      "declaredCapability": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test all three transport types with valid configurations
- [ ] Test transport validation against declared capabilities  
- [ ] Test parameter validation for each transport type
- [ ] Test connection establishment for each transport
- [ ] Test error handling for unsupported transports
- [ ] Test environment variable passing for stdio transport
- [ ] Test HTTP header handling for HTTP/SSE transports

## Acceptance Criteria
- Complete support for all three MCP transport types per ACP spec
- Proper parameter validation for each transport configuration
- Transport type validation against declared agent capabilities
- Working MCP server connections for all supported transports
- Comprehensive error handling with proper ACP error codes
- Environment variable support for stdio transport
- HTTP header support for HTTP/SSE transports
- Full test coverage for all transport configurations

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing code, here's my implementation approach:

### Current State Analysis
- `McpServerConfig` only supports stdio transport with `command`, `args`, and `protocol` fields
- Missing environment variable support for stdio transport
- No HTTP or SSE transport support
- Transport validation against capabilities not implemented

### Implementation Plan

1. **Refactor McpServerConfig Structure**
   - Convert `McpServerConfig` from struct to enum with transport variants
   - Add `EnvVariable` and `HttpHeader` helper structs
   - Support all three ACP-compliant transport types

2. **Transport Type Implementation**
   ```rust
   // New transport-specific configurations
   pub struct StdioTransport {
       pub name: String,
       pub command: String, 
       pub args: Vec<String>,
       pub env: Vec<EnvVariable>,
   }
   
   pub struct HttpTransport {
       pub type_field: String, // "http"
       pub name: String,
       pub url: String,
       pub headers: Vec<HttpHeader>,
   }
   
   pub struct SseTransport {
       pub type_field: String, // "sse" 
       pub name: String,
       pub url: String,
       pub headers: Vec<HttpHeader>,
   }
   ```

3. **Connection Management Updates**
   - Update `McpServerManager::connect_server()` to handle all transport types
   - Add HTTP client using `reqwest` for HTTP transport
   - Add SSE client using `tokio-tungstenite` or similar for SSE transport
   - Maintain existing stdio process spawning with env vars

4. **Transport Validation**
   - Add validation methods for each transport type
   - Verify transport types against agent's declared MCP capabilities
   - Implement proper ACP error responses for unsupported transports

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for each transport configuration validation
   - Integration tests with mock MCP servers for each transport
   - Error handling tests for capability mismatches
   - Environment variable and header passing tests

### Migration Strategy
- Keep backward compatibility during transition
- Update existing stdio configurations to use new enum structure
- Add new transport types as additional enum variants
