# Implement File Location Tracking for Follow-Along Features

## Problem
Our tool call reporting doesn't implement file location tracking required by the ACP specification. This prevents clients from implementing "follow-along" features that track which files the agent is accessing or modifying in real-time.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/tool-calls:

**File Location Tracking Structure:**
```json
{
  "sessionUpdate": "tool_call",
  "toolCallId": "call_001",
  "title": "Reading configuration file",
  "kind": "read",
  "status": "pending",
  "locations": [
    {"path": "/home/user/project/src/main.py", "line": 42},
    {"path": "/home/user/project/config/settings.json"}
  ]
}
```

**Location Structure:**
```json
{
  "path": "/home/user/project/src/main.py",
  "line": 42  // Optional line number
}
```

- No file location tracking in tool call reports
- Missing integration with file operation detection

## File Location Implementation
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct ToolCallLocation {
    pub path: String,
    pub line: Option<u32>,
}

impl ToolCallLocation {
    pub fn new(path: String) -> Self {
        Self { path, line: None }
    }
    
    pub fn with_line(path: String, line: u32) -> Self {
        Self { path, line: Some(line) }
    }
    
    pub fn validate_path(&self) -> Result<(), ValidationError> {
        // Ensure path is absolute
        if !self.path.starts_with('/') && !self.path.contains(':') {
            return Err(ValidationError::RelativePath(self.path.clone()));
        }
        
        // Normalize and validate path format
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct LocationTracker {
    locations: Vec<ToolCallLocation>,
    file_monitor: FileMonitor,
}

impl LocationTracker {
    pub fn add_location(&mut self, location: ToolCallLocation);
    pub fn remove_location(&mut self, path: &str);
    pub fn get_locations(&self) -> &[ToolCallLocation];
    pub fn track_file_operation(&mut self, operation: &FileOperation);
}
```

## Implementation Notes
Add file location tracking comments:
```rust
// ACP file location tracking enables client follow-along features:
// 1. Real-time file access visibility for users
// 2. Client UI can highlight files being processed
// 3. Editor integration can show agent activity
// 4. File tree updates can reflect agent operations
// 5. Location updates provide progress transparency
//
// Location tracking enhances user awareness of agent file activity.
```

### File System Monitoring
- [ ] Implement file system event monitoring
- [ ] Track file access patterns during tool execution
- [ ] Detect file operations through system calls
- [ ] Monitor file descriptor usage
- [ ] Add file access logging and correlation

### Tool Integration Patterns
```rust
impl ToolExecutor {
    pub fn execute_with_location_tracking(&self, tool: &Tool) -> Result<ToolResult> {
        let mut location_tracker = LocationTracker::new();
        
        // Pre-execution: Extract known file paths from parameters
        self.extract_locations_from_parameters(tool, &mut location_tracker);
        
        // During execution: Monitor file system activity
        let result = self.execute_with_monitoring(tool, &mut location_tracker)?;
        
        // Post-execution: Report final locations
        self.report_final_locations(&location_tracker);
        
        Ok(result)
    }
    
    fn extract_locations_from_parameters(&self, tool: &Tool, tracker: &mut LocationTracker) {
        // Look for file path parameters
        if let Some(file_path) = tool.get_parameter("file_path") {
            tracker.add_location(ToolCallLocation::new(file_path));
        }
        
        // Extract paths from structured parameters
        self.extract_paths_recursively(&tool.parameters, tracker);
    }
}
```

## Proposed Solution

The file location tracking feature has been successfully implemented by extending the existing tool call reporting system with file location extraction and ACP-compliant serialization.

### Implementation Architecture

1. **Enhanced Data Structures**: 
   - `ToolCallLocation` struct already existed with path and optional line number
   - `ToolCallReport` already had locations field and ACP serialization methods
   - Added comprehensive file path extraction logic

2. **File Path Extraction System**:
   - Added `extract_file_locations()` method to `ToolCallReport`
   - Extracts paths from common parameter names: `path`, `file_path`, `filepath`, `filename`, `file`, `source`, `dest`, `destination`, `input`, `output`
   - Handles array parameters like `patterns` for glob operations
   - Filters out URLs, commands, and non-file paths
   - Supports glob patterns (`*`, `?`, `[`) as valid file patterns
   - Includes line number extraction from `line`, `line_number`, or `offset` parameters

3. **Path Normalization**:
   - Converts relative paths to absolute paths where possible
   - Preserves glob patterns without modification
   - Cross-platform path handling for Windows and Unix systems

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Integrated into `create_tool_call_report()` method in `tools.rs`
   - Automatically extracts file locations during tool call creation
   - No changes needed to existing ACP serialization - already supported
