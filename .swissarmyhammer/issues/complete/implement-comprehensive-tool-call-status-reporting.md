# Implement Comprehensive Tool Call Status Reporting

## Problem
Our tool call execution doesn't implement the complete status lifecycle reporting required by the ACP specification. We need comprehensive tool call status updates throughout the entire execution process from initial call to completion.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/prompt-turn:

**Tool Call Status Lifecycle:**

**1. Initial Tool Call:**
```json
{
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456", 
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "tool_call",
      "toolCallId": "call_001",
      "title": "Analyzing Python code",
      "kind": "other",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Progress Update:**
```json
{
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "tool_call_update", 
      "toolCallId": "call_001",
      "status": "in_progress"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Completion Update:**
```json
{
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "tool_call_update",
      "toolCallId": "call_001", 
      "status": "completed",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Analysis complete: No syntax errors found..."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Issues
- Tool call status tracking may be incomplete
- Missing comprehensive status lifecycle (pending → in_progress → completed/failed)
- No real-time progress updates during tool execution
- Missing proper content reporting in completion updates
- No error status reporting for failed tools

## Implementation Tasks

### Tool Call Status Types
- [ ] Define complete `ToolCallStatus` enum with all required variants
- [ ] Add `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` statuses
- [ ] Implement proper serialization for tool call statuses

- [ ] Include tool execution results in content field
- [ ] Format tool results appropriately for client consumption
- [ ] Handle different types of tool output (text, files, structured data)

### Error Status Updates
- [ ] Send `tool_call_update` when tool fails (`failed`)
- [ ] Include error information and diagnostic details
- [ ] Provide actionable error messages for users
- [ ] Handle different types of tool failures gracefully

### Cancellation Status Updates
- [ ] Send `tool_call_update` when tool is cancelled (`cancelled`)
- [ ] Handle client-initiated tool cancellation
- [ ] Update status immediately when cancellation requested
- [ ] Clean up tool resources on cancellation

## Tool Call Status Lifecycle Implementation
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum ToolCallStatus {
    #[serde(rename = "pending")]
    Pending,
    #[serde(rename = "in_progress")]
    InProgress,
    #[serde(rename = "completed")]
    Completed,
    #[serde(rename = "failed")]
    Failed,
    #[serde(rename = "cancelled")]
    Cancelled,
}

pub struct ToolCallTracker {
    call_id: String,
    status: ToolCallStatus,
    start_time: SystemTime,
    progress_updates: Vec<String>,
}
```

## Implementation Notes
Add comprehensive tool call status comments:
```rust
// ACP requires complete tool call status lifecycle reporting:
// 1. Initial tool_call notification with pending status
// 2. tool_call_update to in_progress when execution starts
// 3. Optional progress updates during long-running operations
// 4. Final tool_call_update with completed/failed/cancelled status
// 5. Include results/errors in final update content
//
// Status updates provide transparency and enable client UI updates.
```

### Real-time Progress Updates
- [ ] Support streaming progress updates for long-running tools
- [ ] Add progress percentage tracking where applicable
- [ ] Include descriptive progress messages (e.g., "Processing file 3 of 10")
- [ ] Handle progress updates without overwhelming the client
- [ ] Support cancellation of in-progress operations

### Content Formatting
- [ ] Format tool results appropriately for different content types
- [ ] Handle large tool outputs with pagination or truncation
- [ ] Support structured data results (JSON, tables, etc.)
- [ ] Include metadata about tool execution (duration, resource usage)
- [ ] Handle binary or non-text tool outputs

### Tool Call ID Management
- [ ] Generate unique tool call IDs for tracking
- [ ] Maintain tool call registry for status lookups
- [ ] Handle tool call ID conflicts and validation
- [ ] Support tool call correlation across notifications

### Error Handling and Diagnostics
- [ ] Capture detailed error information from failed tools
- [ ] Provide actionable error messages and suggestions
- [ ] Include diagnostic context for debugging
- [ ] Handle tool timeout errors specifically
- [ ] Support error recovery and retry scenarios

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test complete tool call status lifecycle for successful tools
- [ ] Test tool call failure scenarios with proper error status

- Progress `tool_call_update` notifications during execution
- Final `tool_call_update` notifications with results/errors
- Real-time progress updates for long-running operations
- Proper content formatting for different tool output types
- Tool call cancellation with immediate status updates
- Comprehensive test coverage for all status scenarios
- Integration with existing tool and notification systems

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the current codebase, I found that we have strong infrastructure in place but are missing the complete ACP-compliant session notification lifecycle. Here's what exists and what needs to be implemented:

### Current State Analysis

**✅ Already Implemented:**
- `ToolCallReport` structure with complete ACP-compliant fields
- `ToolCallStatus` enum with pending, in_progress, completed, failed statuses  
- `ToolCallHandler` with lifecycle methods:
  - `create_tool_call_report()` - creates reports with pending status
  - `update_tool_call_report()` - allows status updates
  - `complete_tool_call_report()` - sets completed status
  - `fail_tool_call_report()` - sets failed status
- Session notification infrastructure via `SessionNotification` and `SessionUpdate`

**❌ Missing ACP Compliance:**
- No `SessionUpdate::ToolCall` variant for initial tool call notifications
- No `SessionUpdate::ToolCallUpdate` variant for status updates  
- No integration between tool execution and session notifications
- Missing `cancelled` status in `ToolCallStatus`
- No automatic tool call lifecycle reporting during tool execution

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Add Missing ACP SessionUpdate Variants
1. Add `ToolCall` and `ToolCallUpdate` variants to `SessionUpdate` enum in agent_client_protocol
2. Add `Cancelled` status to `ToolCallStatus` enum
3. Update serialization to match ACP specification exactly

#### Phase 2: Integrate Tool Call Lifecycle with Session Notifications  
1. Modify tool execution flow to send initial `SessionUpdate::ToolCall` notification
2. Send `SessionUpdate::ToolCallUpdate` for status transitions (pending → in_progress → completed/failed)
3. Include tool call content in completion notifications
4. Handle cancellation scenarios with proper status reporting

#### Phase 3: Update Tool Execution Integration Points
1. Modify `ToolCallHandler.execute_tool()` to emit lifecycle notifications
2. Update all tool implementations to report progress via the notification system
3. Add error handling with proper failed status reporting
4. Implement cancellation support with cancelled status

#### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Create comprehensive test cases for all status transitions
2. Test concurrent tool execution with independent status tracking  
3. Validate ACP compliance with specification examples
4. Test error scenarios and cancellation flows

### Technical Implementation Details

The core integration will happen in `ToolCallHandler` where we'll:
- Send initial `tool_call` notification when `create_tool_call_report()` is called
- Send `tool_call_update` to `in_progress` when tool execution starts
- Send final `tool_call_update` with results when tool completes/fails
- Include proper content formatting in completion updates
- Support tool cancellation with immediate status updates

This approach leverages the existing solid infrastructure while adding the missing ACP-compliant session notification lifecycle that enables rich client experiences and transparency.
