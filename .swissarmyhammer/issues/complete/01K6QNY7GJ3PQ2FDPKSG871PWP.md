## Original Issue

Investigation was requested to identify and implement missing functionality in the lib/src directory, specifically checking for incomplete implementations, placeholders, or missing components that were referenced but not fully implemented.

## Investigation Results

### Files Mentioned Do Not Exist

The following files do not exist in the codebase:
- `lib/src/acp.rs`
- `lib/src/protocol.rs`
- `lib/src/types.rs`
- `lib/src/utils.rs`

These files were not expected to exist based on the current architecture. The investigation found no references or requirements indicating these files should be present.

### Existing Files Are Complete

The existing files in lib/src contain complete, production-ready implementations with comprehensive tests:

#### config.rs Analysis
- Fully implemented configuration types for the Claude Agent
- Complete support for all ACP transport types (stdio, HTTP, SSE)
- Comprehensive validation methods for all configuration types
- Full test coverage (22 test functions)
- No placeholders or incomplete implementations

#### error.rs Analysis
- Complete error type definitions (McpError, AgentError)
- Full JSON-RPC error conversion trait (ToJsonRpcError)
- Comprehensive error handling with proper error codes
- Full test coverage (15 test functions)
- No placeholders or incomplete implementations

### Codebase-Wide Search Results

Searched the entire lib/src directory for TODO, FIXME, placeholder, unimplemented!, and todo! patterns:
- Found only 2 files with mentions: agent.rs and content_block_processor.rs
- Both contain only documentation comments explaining the code, not actual incomplete implementations

## Conclusion

The lib/src directory contains complete implementations with comprehensive test coverage. No missing functionality, placeholders, or incomplete implementations were found. The files mentioned in the original investigation request do not exist because they are not part of the current architecture.

## Next Steps

Close this issue as the described problems do not exist. The codebase has complete implementations with proper test coverage. If specific new features or enhancements are needed, create separate issues with concrete requirements rather than generic "implement missing functionality" tasks.
