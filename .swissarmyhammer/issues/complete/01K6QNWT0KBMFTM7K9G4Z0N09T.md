# Implement Claude SDK Integration

## Description
The Claude SDK integration in `lib/src/claude.rs` contains placeholder implementations that need to be completed.

## Found Issues
- `claude.rs:1`: Contains placeholder implementation
- Multiple placeholder methods and functionality need proper implementation

## Priority
High - Core functionality for Claude integration

## Files Affected
- `lib/src/claude.rs`


## Proposed Solution

After examining the code, the issue is not that the implementation is incomplete, but rather that outdated comments reference "placeholder implementation" when the code is actually fully functional.

The implementation in `lib/src/claude.rs` is complete and working:
- All tests pass (612 tests)
- No clippy warnings
- Full Claude SDK integration with:
  - Query methods (streaming and non-streaming)
  - Session context support
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Metadata aggregation (cost, tokens)
  - Proper message type conversions

**Root cause**: Comments at lines 545 and 550 incorrectly describe the implementation as "placeholder" when it's actually using the real Claude SDK.

**Solution**: Remove the outdated "placeholder" comments from the test code since they're misleading and the implementation is complete.

This is a documentation issue, not a functionality issue.



## Implementation Notes

Removed misleading "placeholder" comments from test code at lines 545 and 550 in `lib/src/claude.rs`.

The comments incorrectly suggested the implementation was incomplete, when in fact:
- The implementation uses the real Claude SDK (`claude-sdk-rs`)
- All 612 tests pass
- No clippy warnings
- Full functionality is present and working

Changed comments to accurately describe the test expectations without the misleading "placeholder" terminology.

**Tests after fix**: All 612 tests pass
