# Implement Complete Tool Call Reporting Structure

## Problem
Our tool call reporting doesn't implement the complete structure required by the ACP specification. We need comprehensive tool call metadata including kinds, locations, raw input/output, and proper status lifecycle management.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/tool-calls:

**Complete Tool Call Structure:**
```json
{
  "sessionUpdate": "tool_call",
  "toolCallId": "call_001",
  "title": "Reading configuration file",
  "kind": "read",
  "status": "pending",
  "content": [],
  "locations": [
    {"path": "/home/user/project/config.json", "line": 42}
  ],
  "rawInput": {"file_path": "/path/to/file", "mode": "read"},
  "rawOutput": {"content": "file contents...", "size": 1024}
}
```

## Current Issues
- Tool call reporting may not include all metadata fields
- Missing tool kind classification and reporting
- No file location tracking for follow-along features
- Raw input/output capture and reporting unclear
- Incomplete tool call metadata structure

    pub raw_input: Option<serde_json::Value>,
    pub raw_output: Option<serde_json::Value>,
}

impl ToolCallReport {
    pub fn new(id: String, title: String, kind: ToolKind) -> Self;
    pub fn update_status(&mut self, status: ToolCallStatus);
    pub fn add_content(&mut self, content: ToolCallContent);
    pub fn add_location(&mut self, location: ToolCallLocation);
    pub fn set_raw_input(&mut self, input: serde_json::Value);
    pub fn set_raw_output(&mut self, output: serde_json::Value);
}
```

## Implementation Notes
Add tool call reporting comments:
```rust
// ACP requires comprehensive tool call reporting with rich metadata:
// 1. toolCallId: Unique identifier for correlation across updates
// 2. title: Human-readable description of tool operation
// 3. kind: Classification for UI optimization and icon selection
// 4. status: Lifecycle state (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
// 5. content: Output content produced by tool execution
// 6. locations: File paths for follow-along features
// 7. rawInput/rawOutput: Detailed I/O data for debugging
//
// Complete reporting enables rich client experiences and debugging.
```

## Proposed Solution

After examining the ACP specification at https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/tool-calls, I will implement the complete tool call reporting structure by:

### 1. Data Structure Implementation
- Create `ToolCallReport` struct with all ACP-required fields
- Implement `ToolKind` enum with classifications: read, edit, delete, move, search, execute, think, fetch, other  
- Implement `ToolCallStatus` enum with states: pending, in_progress, completed, failed
- Create supporting structs: `ToolCallContent`, `ToolCallLocation`

### 2. Tool Call ID Management
- Use ULID for unique tool call identifiers within session scope
- Implement ID generation and collision detection

### 3. Title Generation System
- Create context-aware human-readable titles based on tool name and parameters
- Examples: "Reading configuration file", "Writing text to file", "Executing terminal command"

### 4. Integration with SessionUpdate
- Send `sessionUpdate: "tool_call"` for initial tool call creation
- Send `sessionUpdate: "tool_call_update"` for progress updates
- Integrate with existing session notification system

### 5. Raw Input/Output Capture
- Capture tool parameters as `rawInput` JSON
- Capture tool results as `rawOutput` JSON  
- Add security sanitization to prevent sensitive data leaks

### 6. Location Tracking
- Track file paths and optional line numbers for file operations
- Enable "follow-along" features for clients

## Implementation Steps
1. Define core data structures in tools.rs
2. Implement tool classification logic
3. Add tool call reporting to ToolCallHandler
4. Integrate with session update notifications
5. Add comprehensive test coverage
