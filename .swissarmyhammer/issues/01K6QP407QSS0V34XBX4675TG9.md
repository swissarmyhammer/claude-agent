# Remove Per-Command and Default Execution Timeouts from Terminal Manager

## Description
Remove per-command and default execution timeout functionality from terminal manager while preserving graceful shutdown timeout for SIGKILL escalation.

## Problem
Command execution timeouts create artificial limitations:
- Commands may legitimately take a long time (builds, tests, large file operations)
- Users cannot predict when operations will be terminated
- Creates poor developer experience when legitimate commands are killed
- No meaningful way to distinguish between "hung" and "slow" commands

## Components to Modify

### Files to change:
- `lib/src/terminal_manager.rs:66-86` - Remove per-command timeout config
- `lib/src/terminal_manager.rs:630-676` - Remove `execute_with_timeout` method
- `lib/src/terminal_manager.rs:1287-1406` - Remove timeout-related tests

### Specific Changes:
1. **TimeoutConfig struct**: Remove `default_execution_timeout` and `command_timeouts` fields
2. **Keep graceful_shutdown_timeout**: This is needed for SIGKILL escalation during shutdown
3. **Remove execute_with_timeout**: Replace with normal execution without artificial time limits
4. **Remove timeout tests**: Remove `test_timeout_triggers_kill` and related tests

## Preserve SIGKILL Timeout
**Keep the graceful shutdown timeout** - this is different and necessary:
- Used when explicitly shutting down terminals
- Prevents zombie processes during cleanup
- 5-second timeout before escalating SIGTERM to SIGKILL

## Documentation Requirements
Add comment in `TimeoutConfig`:
```rust
// IMPORTANT: Do not add execution timeouts for commands.
// Commands should be allowed to run until completion or explicit user termination.
// Only graceful shutdown timeout is appropriate for cleanup scenarios.
// Execution timeouts create poor developer experience for legitimate long-running operations.
```

## Priority
Medium - Improves developer experience and removes artificial limitations

## Files Affected  
- `lib/src/terminal_manager.rs`
