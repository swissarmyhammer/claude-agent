# Implement Agent Thought Chunk Updates

## Problem
Our agent implementation doesn't send agent thought chunk updates via `session/update` notifications to provide transparency about internal reasoning and planning processes. This limits client visibility into agent decision-making.

## ACP Specification Requirements
From agent-client-protocol specification:

**Agent Thought Chunk Format:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456", 
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "agent_thought_chunk",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "I need to analyze this code systematically. First, I'll check for syntax errors, then look for potential type issues..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Provide transparency into agent reasoning and decision-making
- Enable clients to show agent thinking process to users
- Support debugging and understanding of agent behavior
- Enhance user trust through visibility into agent logic

## Current Issues
- No agent thought chunk updates sent during processing
- Internal reasoning and planning not visible to clients
- Missing transparency in agent decision-making process
- Limited insight into agent problem-solving approach

## Agent Thought Implementation
```rust
impl ClaudeAgent {
    async fn send_agent_thought(&self, session_id: &SessionId, thought: &str) -> crate::Result<()> {
        let notification = SessionNotification {
            session_id: session_id.clone(),
            update: SessionUpdate::AgentThoughtChunk {
                content: ContentBlock::Text(TextContent {
                    text: thought.to_string(),
                    annotations: None,
                    meta: None,
                }),
            },
            meta: None,
        };
        
        self.send_session_update(notification).await
    }
    
    async fn process_prompt_with_thoughts(
        &self,
        session_id: &SessionId,
        prompt: &[ContentBlock],
    ) -> crate::Result<PromptResponse> {
        // Send initial analysis thought
        self.send_agent_thought(
            session_id,
            "Analyzing the user's request and determining the best approach..."
        ).await?;
        
        // Analyze prompt and generate plan
        let analysis = self.analyze_prompt(prompt).await?;
        
        // Send planning thought
        self.send_agent_thought(
            session_id,
            &format!("I'll approach this by: {}", analysis.approach_description)
        ).await?;
        
        // Continue with execution...
        self.execute_plan_with_thoughts(session_id, &analysis.plan).await
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
Add agent thought chunk comments:
```rust
// ACP agent thought chunks provide reasoning transparency:
// 1. Send agent_thought_chunk updates during internal processing
// 2. Verbalize reasoning steps and decision-making process
// 3. Provide insight into problem analysis and planning
// 4. Enable clients to show agent thinking to users
// 5. Support debugging and understanding of agent behavior
//
// Thought chunks enhance user trust and system transparency.
```

### Reasoning Step Detection
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ReasoningStep {
    ProblemAnalysis,
    ToolSelection,
    StrategyPlanning,
    TaskDecomposition,
    DecisionMaking,
    ResultEvaluation,
}

impl AgentReasoner {
    pub async fn reason_through_step(
        &self,
        step: ReasoningStep,
        context: &ReasoningContext,
    ) -> Result<ReasoningResult, ReasoningError> {
        let thought = match step {
            ReasoningStep::ProblemAnalysis => {
                format!("Analyzing the problem: {}", context.problem_description)
            }
            ReasoningStep::ToolSelection => {
                format!("Selecting appropriate tools: {}", context.available_tools.join(", "))
            }
            ReasoningStep::StrategyPlanning => {
                format!("Planning approach: {}", context.strategy_description)
            }
            // ... other reasoning steps
        };
        
        // Send thought update
        self.send_agent_thought(&context.session_id, &thought).await?;
        
        // Perform actual reasoning
        self.execute_reasoning_step(step, context).await
    }
}
